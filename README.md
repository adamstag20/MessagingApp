# MessagingApp
This Application was made for an Elements of Software Engineering class. It is a messaging application that allows users
to create an account, login, make individual/groupchats and send messages. This project has helped me learn more about software development
in how to use JavaScript and the MERN Stack to create a project that is accessible over the internet.
